# BeatSaberTweaks
Plugin for Beat Saber containing the following tweaks:  
- In game clock  
- Moveable energy bar  
- Change volume of note hits and misses  
- Change volume of menu background music  
- Move Score  
- No Arrows (Party)  
- One Color (Party)

- Override Note Speed (Party) (The speed the note move towards you)

(Features marked 'Party' will work in Party Mode only as to not mess with online leaderboards)  
  
**Known Issues:**  
Vibration is disabled when One Color is turned on, since one controller will vibrate when the other hits notes

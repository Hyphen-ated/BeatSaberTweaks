# BeatSaberTweaks
Plugin for Beat Saber containing the following tweaks:  
In game clock  
Moveable energy bar  
Change volume of note hits and misses  
Change volume of menu background music  
Move Score (Same as Rolo's Score Mover plugin)  
No Arrows (Party)  
One Color (Party)  
Remove Bombs (Party)  
Remove High Walls/Overhead Obstacles (Party)  
Change Song Speed (Party) (Same as PracticePlugin, but without needing No Fail)  
Override Note Speed (Party) (The speed the note move towards you)  
Toggle third person camera (If CameraPlus is installed)  

(Features marked 'Party' will work in Party Mode only as to not mess with online leaderboards)  
**Known Issues:**  
Vibration is disabled when One Color is turned on, since one controller will vibrate when the other hits notes.

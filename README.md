# BeatSaberTweaks
Plugin for Beat Saber containing the following tweaks:  
- In game clock  
- Moveable energy bar  
- Change volume of note hits and misses  
- Change volume of menu background music  
- Move Score (Same as Rolo's Score Mover plugin)  
- Toggle third person camera (If CameraPlus is installed)  
- Change Song Speed (Party) (Same as PracticePlugin, but without needing No Fail)  
- No Arrows (Party)  
- One Color (Party)  
- Remove Bombs (Party)  
- X: Override Note Speed (Party) (The speed the note move towards you)  
- While on the Main menu screen hold both triggers for 5 seconds ;)  
  
(Features marked 'Party' will work in Party Mode only as to not mess with online leaderboards)  
**Known Issues:**  
Features marked with an X broke with the new updated and will be fixed later  
Vibration is disabled when One Color is turned on, since one controller will vibrate when the other hits notes
